/**
 * A simple {@code LogRecord} formatter that will output a simple line with the log message tagged
 * as an error.  This formatter is intended to be used for {@link ConsoleHandler} instances only,
 * since it conveys no extra information about the log record, such as time and date, level, etc.
 * It is also mostly suitable only to show warnings or severe errors, and ignore lower level
 * messages that are not important or relevant enough to be shown to the end user.
