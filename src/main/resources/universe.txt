/**
 * The thermal resistance of an insulating material, in thermal ohms, is the R-value divided by the
 * thickness of the material, in meters.  The name expresses an analogy between heat flow and
 * electric current: the temperature difference (in kelvins or °C) corresponds to electric potential
 * difference (in volts), while the heat flow rate (in watts, equal to joules per second)
 * corresponds to electric current (in amperes).  By Ohm's Law, the ratio of potential to current is
 * the electric resistance (measured in ohms).  Thus the corresponding ratio of temperature
 * difference to heat flow rate is measured in thermal ohms.

/**
 * Represents the money property, whose units are the currencies from the different countries.
 *
 * Currency names and exchange rates are automatically loaded by the metric engine from the
 * following sources:
 *
 * http://openexchangerates.org/latest.json
 * http://openexchangerates.org/currencies.json
 *
 * Note the peculiar syntax of the money property definition. It will only be allowed once in a
 * universe definition file, and what identifies it is the $ sign in front of the opening brace.
 *
 * Between braces you can specify aliases for convenient names for certain currencies. The most
 * noticeable one is the US Dollar, which is only recognized as "USD" or "United States Dollar", but
 * it almost always is convenient to refer to it simply as "dollar". Alias definitions consists of
 * the currency code in its original upercase form, followed by a colon (:) and a comma-separated
 * list of aliases and a semicolon. Aliases should be specified in title case (first letter
 * capitalized) and in their singular form. The system will automatically add the lowercase form and
 * plural forms of both. That is, when specifying "Dollar" you automatically obtain "Dollars",
 * "dollar" and "dollars" for free.
